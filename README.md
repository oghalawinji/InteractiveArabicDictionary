# The Interactive Arabic Dictionary
This project includes the source file for the Interactive Arabic Dictionary, developed by HIAST(2008-2015).
This version uses JPA 2.1 in the persistence layer instead of Hibernate 3.2.5. This migration was done in a graduation project in HIAST by student Omar Ghalawinji. Supervised by: Dr. Rebdawi, G., Dr. Desouki, M., Eng. Alhassan, F.
